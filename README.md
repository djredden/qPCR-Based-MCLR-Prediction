# qPCR-Based-MCLR-Prediction
 
This repository contains the data and code required to reproduce the analyses in the manuscript titled *qPCR-Based Prediction of Low-Level Microcystin-LR Using mcyE and Passive Sampling Across Multiple Lakes Over Three Years*

N.B. Some model objects - contained in an ignored "model-fits/" directory - are too large to save on GitHub and will need to be run locally.
