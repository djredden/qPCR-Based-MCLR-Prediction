	abstract = {The potential for cyanobacterial blooms to impact recreational and drinking water source quality is a growing concern. Numerous monitoring tools have been developed that can alert stakeholders to the onset of cyanobacterial blooms to initiate mitigation efforts for waters used for recreation or drinking water supply. Early warning monitoring systems need to consider multiple aspects of a cyanobacterial bloom: whether a bloom is occurring in the source water, whether it might be transported to drinking water intakes, whether toxin or taste and odor compound producers are present and what proportion of the cells in a bloom they comprise, and whether cells are entering a utility at concentrations above threshold levels. No single monitoring tool can provide all this information, so multi-barrier approaches are needed. Reviews of monitoring tools and their variations are available, but they are generally limited to one type of tool. Instead, a review and comparison of all the available tools is needed to inform stakeholders of them and their relative advantages and limitations. Therefore, this review covers conventional tools including microscopic enumeration, pigment extraction, qPCR, probes, and remote sensing as well as emerging techniques including next-generation sequencing, photonic systems, biosensors, drones, and applications of machine learning and discusses them primarily from a practical and operational standpoint. Moreover, a three-tier framework is proposed for designing comprehensive early warning systems that groups monitoring tools by their analytical targets: biological activity or algal biomass, cyanobacteria or cyanobacteria-related genes, and cyanobacterial metabolites. First tier tools are generally simple and inexpensive to use, including turbidity, optical density, visual inspection, drones, chlorophyll a, and adenosine triphosphate. Changes in water quality conditions detected using a first tier tool triggers the use of a second tier tools for identification and quantification of cyanobacteria by microscopy, phycocyanin, biosensors, hyperspectral remote sensing, or next-generation sequencing. If potentially harmful concentrations of cyanobacteria are confirmed, third tier tools are deployed for quantifying concentrations of cyanotoxins and taste and odor compounds or the genes that encode for them using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, mass spectrometry, qPCR, or other analytical methods. This framework is designed to minimize the time and cost associated with cyanobacteria monitoring without compromising the ability of stakeholders to detect the onset of a bloom.},

	abstract = {Toxic bloom-forming cyanobacteria are a global health hazard. These photosynthetic microorganisms produce a suite of secondary metabolite toxins including hepatotoxins such as microcystin, nodularin and cylindrospermopsin and neurotoxins such as saxitoxin. These toxins can threaten the safety of drinking water supplies and in the case of saxitoxin, can accumulate to dangerous levels in shellfish, affecting the seafood industry. Several molecular methods have been described for the detection and quantification of toxigenic cyanobacteria, however, to date there is no method for the simultaneous detection and quantification of hepatotoxin and neurotoxin producing genera. This paper describes the development and validation of a quadruplex quantitative-PCR (qPCR) assay capable of detecting and quantifying toxin genes from the microcystin, nodularin, cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin biosynthesis pathways. The primers and probes employed in this assay were designed from conserved regions within toxin biosynthesis genes from most of the representative cyanobacterial genera. The qPCR assay was optimized to reliably determine the copy number of cyanotoxin biosynthesis genes, as well as an internal cyanobacteria 16S rDNA control, in a single reaction. Amplification efficiency and reproducibility were similar among the cyanotoxin genes, while the sensitivity of the reaction for the toxin genes ranged from 102 to 106 gene copies per reaction. This multiplex qPCR assay is a powerful tool for detecting and quantifying potentially toxic cyanobacteria in laboratory and field samples. Such technology will enable water quality and food safety authorities to better forecast, evaluate and reduce the impact of future harmful algal bloom events.},

	abstract = {In February 1996, an outbreak of illness occurred at a hemodialysis clinic in Caruaru, Pernambuco State—Brazil. At this clinic 116 (89\%) of 131 patients experienced visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, and muscle weakness, following routine haemodialysis treatment. Subsequently, 100 patients developed acute liver failure. As of December 1996, 52 of the deaths could be attributed to a common syndrome now called ‘Caruaru Syndrome’. Examination of previous years' phytoplankton counts showed that cyanobacteria were dominant in the water supply reservoir since 1990. Analyses of carbon and other resins from the clinic's water treatment system plus serum and liver tissue of patients led to the identification of two groups of hepatotoxic cyanotoxins: microcystins (cyclic heptapeptides) in all of these samples and cylindrospermopsin (alkaloid hepatotoxic) in the carbon and resins. Comparison of victims symptoms and pathology with animal studies on these two cyanotoxins, leads us to conclude that the major contributing factor to death of the dialysis patients was intravenous exposure to microcystins, specifically microcystin-YR, -LR and -AR. In 2000, a review of the Brazilian regulation for drinking water quality, promoted by Brazilian Health Ministry with collaboration of PAHO, incorporated cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins into this new regulation as parameters that must to be monitored for water quality control.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) are a primary source of water quality degradation in eutrophic lakes. The occurrence of cyanoHABs is ubiquitous and expected to increase with current climate and land use change scenarios. However, it is currently unknown what environmental parameters are important for indicating the presence of cyanoHAB toxins making them difficult to predict or even monitor on time-scales relevant to protecting public health. Using qPCR, we aimed to quantify genes within the microcystin operon (mcy) to determine which cyanobacterial taxa, and what percentage of the total cyanobacterial community, were responsible for microcystin production in four eutrophic lakes. We targeted Microcystis-16S, mcyA, and Microcystis, Planktothrix, and Anabaena-specific mcyE genes. We also measured microcystins and several biological, chemical, and physical parameters—such as temperature, lake stability, nutrients, pigments and cyanobacterial community composition (CCC)—to search for possible correlations to gene copy abundance and MC production. All four lakes contained Microcystis-mcyE genes and high percentages of toxic Microcystis, suggesting Microcystis was the dominant microcystin producer. However, all genes were highly variable temporally, and in few cases, correlated with increased temperature and nutrients as the summer progressed. Interestingly, toxin gene abundances (and biomass indicators) were anti-correlated with microcystin in all lakes except the largest lake, Lake Mendota. Similarly, gene abundance and microcystins differentially correlated to CCC in all lakes. Thus, we conclude that the presence of microcystin genes are not a useful tool for eliciting an ecological role for toxins in the environment, nor are microcystin genes (e.g. DNA) a good indicator of toxins in the environment.},

	abstract = {Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and digital PCR (dPCR) methods have revolutionized environmental microbiology, yielding quantitative organism-specific data of nucleic acid targets in the environment. Such data are essential for characterizing interactions and processes of microbial communities, assessing microbial contaminants in the environment (water, air, fomites), and developing interventions (water treatment, surface disinfection, air purification) to curb infectious disease transmission. However, our review of recent qPCR and dPCR literature in our field of health-related environmental microbiology showed that many researchers are not reporting necessary and sufficient controls and methods, which would serve to strengthen their study results and conclusions. Here, we describe the application, utility, and interpretation of the suite of controls needed to make high quality qPCR and dPCR measurements of microorganisms in the environment. Our presentation is organized by the discrete steps and operations typical of this measurement process. We propose systematic terminology to minimize ambiguity and aid comparisons among studies. Example schemes for batching and combining controls for efficient work flow are demonstrated. We describe critical reporting elements for enhancing data credibility, and we provide an element checklist in the Supporting Information. Additionally, we present several key principles in metrology as context for laboratories to devise their own quality assurance and quality control reporting framework. Following the EMMI guidelines will improve comparability and reproducibility among qPCR and dPCR studies in environmental microbiology, better inform engineering and public health actions for preventing disease transmission through environmental pathways, and for the most pressing issues in the discipline, focus the weight of evidence in the direction toward solutions.},

	abstract = {Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were used in this study to explore passive sampling for the detection of microcystin-LR (MC-LR). POCIS were deployed in triplicate for a minimum of 28 days at the inlet and outlet of a 1 km2, 4.2 km long lake in Atlantic Canada. POCIS results were compared to lake water grab sampling and followed a similar trend. Laboratory POCIS studies using lake water spiked with known MC-LR concentrations were used to estimate lake water concentrations over the deployment period by calculating POCIS sampling rate (Rs). The Rs for MC-LR in this lake water was found to be 0.045 (±0.001) and 0.041 (±0.001) L per day for initial concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 μg L−1. Estimated MC-LR concentrations from POCIS were generally higher than grab sampling results, especially at the outlet to the lake from late September to late October. This could possibly give a better picture of MC-LR concentrations in the lake; MC-LR concentrations can fluctuate substantially over short time periods. POCIS were able to detect MC-LR in the water stream when grab sampling resulted in non-detects (i.e., below detection limit of LC-MS/MS). The use of passive sampling for MC-LR could have beneficial implications for public health and toxicity testing by lowering detection limits for this chronically and acutely toxic chemical. The correlation of aqueous MC-LR concentrations to POCIS MC-LR concentrations needs further study.},

They produce a high number of bioactive molecules, among which some are cyanotoxins. Cyanobacterial growth at high densities, forming blooms, is increasing in extension and frequency, following anthropogenic activities and climate changes, giving rise to some concern for human health and animal life exposed to cyanotoxins. Numerous cases of lethal poisonings have been associated with cyanotoxins ingestion in wild animal and livestock. In humans few episodes of lethal or severe human poisonings have been recorded after acute or short-term exposure, but the repeated/chronic exposure to low cyanotoxin levels remains a critical issue. The properties of the most frequently detected cyanotoxins (namely, microcystins, nodularins, cylindrospermopsin and neurotoxins) are here critically reviewed, describing for each toxin the available information on producing organisms, biosynthesis/genetic and occurrence, with a focus on the toxicological profile (including kinetics, acute systemic toxicity, mechanism and mode of action, local effects, repeated toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity; human health effects and epidemiological studies; animal poisoning) with the derivation of health-based values and considerations on the risks for human health.},

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cases (219) were matched with healthy controls (438) based on age and gender and conditional logistic regression models and Restricted cubic splines were used to evaluate the association between MC-LR exposure and IBD risk. We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression levels of inflammatory factors. The levels of protein expression in the colorectum were determined using Western blotting (WB). Compared to the lowest quartile of serum MC-LR levels, the adjusted odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the highest quartiles of serum MC-LR levels were 5.51 (2.70, 11.21). The RCS was shown the association between serum MC-LR levels and IBD risk was nonlinear (Pnonlinear {\textless} 0.001). In the animal experiments, MC-LR resulted in colorectal injury via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our study provides the evidence that serum MC-LR exposure is significantly associated with the risk of IBD in China. Animal study results indicate that MC-LR probably causes IBD via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.},

	abstract = {Microcystins represent an extraordinarily large family of cyclic heptapeptide toxins that are nonribosomally synthesized by various cyanobacteria. Microcystins specifically inhibit the eukaryotic protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Their outstanding variability makes them particularly useful for studies on the evolution of structure-function relationships in peptide synthetases and their genes. Analyses of microcystin synthetase genes provide valuable clues for the potential and limits of combinatorial biosynthesis. We have sequenced and analyzed 55.6 kb of the potential microcystin synthetase gene (mcy) cluster from the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix agardhii CYA 126. The cluster contains genes for peptide synthetases (mcyABC), polyketide synthases (PKSs; mcyD), chimeric enzymes composed of peptide synthetase and PKS modules (mcyEG), a putative thioesterase (mcyT), a putative ABC transporter (mcyH), and a putative peptide-modifying enzyme (mcyJ). The gene content and arrangement and the sequence of specific domains in the gene products differ from those of the mcy cluster in Microcystis, a unicellular cyanobacterium. The data suggest an evolution of mcy clusters from, rather than to, genes for nodularin (a related pentapeptide) biosynthesis. Our data do not support the idea of horizontal gene transfer of complete mcy gene clusters between the genera. We have established a protocol for stable genetic transformation of Planktothrix, a genus that is characterized by multicellular filaments exhibiting continuous motility. Targeted mutation of mcyJ revealed its function as a gene coding for a O-methyltransferase. The mutant cells produce a novel microcystin variant exhibiting reduced inhibitory activity toward protein phosphatases.},

	abstract = {Microcystins are a family of more than 50 structurally similar hepatotoxins produced by species of freshwater cyanobacteria, primarily Microcystis aeruginosa. They are monocyclic heptapeptides, characterised by some invariant amino acids, including one of unusual structure which is essential for expression of toxicity. Microcystins are chemically stable, but suffer biodegradation in reservoir waters. The most common member of the family, microcystin-LR (L and R identifying the 2 variable amino acids, in this case leucine and arginine respectively) has an ld50 in mice and rats of 36–122μg/kg by various routes, including aerosol inhalation. Although human illnesses attributed to microcystins include gastroenteritis and allergic/irritation reactions, the primary target of the toxin is the liver, where disruption of the cytoskeleton, consequent on inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, causes massive hepatic haemorrhage. Microcystins are tight-binding inhibitors of these protein phosphatases, with inhibition constants in the nanomolar range or lower. Uptake of microcystins into the liver occurs via a carrier-mediated transport system, and several inhibitors of uptake can antagonise the toxic effects of microcystins. The most effective of these is the antibiotic rifampin (a drug approved for clinical use), which protects mice and rats against microcystin-induced lethality when given prophylactically and, in some cases, therapeutically.},

Sensitive and robust methods that allow for early and expedited HAB detection across large landscape scales are needed. Among the suite of HAB detection tools available, a powerful option exists in genetics-based approaches utilizing environmental sampling, also termed environmental DNA (eDNA). Here we provide a detailed methodological review of three HAB eDNA approaches (quantitative PCR, high throughput sequencing, and isothermal amplification). We then summarize and synthesize recently pub­ lished eDNA applications covering a variety of HAB surveillance and research objectives, all with a specific emphasis in the detection of two widely problematic freshwater species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Prymnesium parvum. In our summary and conclusion we build on this literature by discussing ways in which eDNA methods could be advanced to improve HAB detection. We also discuss ways in which eDNA data could be used to potentially provide novel insight into the ecology, mitigation, and prediction of HABs.},

	abstract = {Passive techniques are a constantly evolving method of monitoring water pollution, allowing the simultaneous sampling and concentration of selected chemical compounds. The most popular aqueous passive samplers are those in which sorbents are used as receiving phases, including: the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS). Originally, POCIS contained the copolymer poly(divinylbenzene)-co-N-vinylpyrrolidone, which allowed the collection of analytes with 0 ≤ log Kow ≤ 5, The limitation of the use of conventional samplers for sampling water pollutants only with a specific polarity has resulted in the fact that innovative sorbents are used more and more in POCIS-like samplers. In recent years, application of several innovative sorbents in POCIS-like samplers, for example: mixed-mode ion exchange polymeric sorbents, ionic liquids, molecularly imprinted polymers and carbon nanotubes has been described. This is the first review in which the usability of classical and innovative sorbents used in passive techniques principles has been collected and compared, and it has been shown that the type of sorbent can significantly affect the efficiency of sampling pollutants in the aquatic environment. The major points are the following: 1) principle of operation, of passive samplers, 2) characteristics of POCIS and sorbents used as receiving phases, 3) sampler calibration methods and environmental factors affecting their operation, 4) a detailed description of the application possibilities of conventional and innovative sorbents used in POCIS-like samplers. This review shows the growing number of works on the use of innovative sorption materials to overcome limitation of originally designed POCIS, and the published results, allow us to conclude that the type of sorbent may be a key factor in increasing the applicability of POCIS-like samplers.},

	abstract = {Poisoning of humans resulting from consumption of water affected by the toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was first reported almost 20 years ago from Palm Island, northern Queensland, Australia. Since that time a great deal has been learned about this organism and cylindrospermopsin (CYN), the toxin it produces. This article reviews the information now available to us. It summarizes aspects of the chemistry of the toxin—now known to be produced by some cyanobacterial species other than C. raciborskii—and its biosynthesis and chemical synthesis in vitro, as well as its detection and measurement by chemical and biological assay. Some of the factors affecting toxin production by cultured isolates of C. raciborskii are reviewed and the conditions that cause its release from the cells described. The occurrence of CYN in water bodies and the management strategies used to minimize the harmful effects of the toxin are outlined. These include a range of water-treatment practices now in place to remove CYN-producing organisms and/or to neutralize the toxin together with some management procedures that have been tried, with varying degrees of success, to prevent buildup of blooms of the offending organisms. Some of the public-health considerations arising from exposure to water supplies affected by CYN are summarized along with the risk factors and guidance values as they are currently applied. Among the more recent developments described are those that come from the application of molecular techniques for characterizing toxic and nontoxic strains and for exploring the genetic aspects of CYN production. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

MCs were detected in epilimnetic water samples at concentrations up to 14 μg/L, but their levels in raw water in DWTPs were below 1 μg/L WHO guideline value for drinking water. Conventional treatment technologies (coagulation/filtration) eliminated cyanobacteria and intracellular toxins but had a limited removal efficiency for extracellular toxins. MCs were regularly detected in final treated water, especially in DWTPs equipped only with the conventional treatment, but their concentrations were below the quantitation limit of discrete sampling ({\textless}25 ng/L). Passive samplers in combination with LC-MS/MS analysis provided excellent sensitivity allowing to detect time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of MCs as low as 20–200 pg/L after 14-d deployment. Median MC TWA concentrations in the treated water from the individual DWTPs were 1–12 ng/L, and most likely did not present significant health risks. Passive samplers well reflected spatiotemporal variations of MCs, actual concentrations of extracellular toxins, MC removal efficiency in DWTPs, and toxin concentrations in the treated water. Passive sampling can be effectively used for assessment and management of MC health risks during DWTP operation.},

A disruption of the molting process in both Daphnia spp. was noted when these species were fed with MRC cells.

However, monitoring frequencies and long analytical turnaround times negatively impacted the effective use of monitoring data for rapid bloom detection and prompt implementation of reactive measures to control blooms/bloom-related issues. Thus, a tiered monitoring approach is recommended: Tier 1–event detection, Tier 2–cyanobacteria confirmation, and Tier 3–metabolite confirmation. Most utilities (68\%) implement source control strategies for cyanobacteria, with algaecides and aeration being the most frequently used (36\%). Utilities relied on manufacturer recommendations to design source control strategies, although site-specific optimization is needed based on water quality/bloom conditions. Control strategies were restricted by source geometry, limited optimization, metabolite generation, and environmental impacts. Successful source control of cyanobacteria was further negatively impacted by external nutrient loading. Therefore, source control strategies should be implemented jointly with external nutrient control initiatives.},

	abstract = {In the present study, we have evaluated the effectiveness of a passive sampler for polar organic chemicals to accumulate a group of widespread and hazardous tumor-promoting toxins produced in cyanobacterial water blooms—microcystins (MC). The previously optimized configuration of the sampler based on polycarbonate membrane and Oasis HLB sorbent (2.75 mg/cm2) was validated under various exposure scenarios in laboratory and field. Calibration of the passive sampler conducted under variable conditions and concentrations of MC revealed linearity of the sampling up to 4 weeks. The sampling rates of microcystins for two different exposure scenarios were derived (e.g., MC-LR: Rs = 0.017 L/day under static and 0.087 L/d under turbulent conditions). Rs values were further used for calculations of time-weighted average concentrations in natural water. Improved sensitivity and selectivity of the in-house-made sampler was observed in comparison with the commercially available Polar Organic Compound Integrative Sampler (POCIS). Comparisons of grab and passive sampling methods were performed during cyanobacterial water bloom season in the Brno reservoir, Czech Republic in 2008. Data obtained by passive sampling provided a more relevant picture of the situation and enabled better assessment of potential risks. The present study demonstrated that the modification of POCIS is suitable for monitoring of occurrence and retrospective estimations of microcystin water concentrations, especially with respect to the control of drinking water quality.},

	abstract = {Fresh and brackish water cyanobacterial blooms and their associated toxins appear to be increasing globally. Current sampling methodologies for cyanotoxins typically involve point (grab) samples, and are subject to variability due to spatial and temporal heterogeneity, hydrological conditions, and the presence or absence of surface accumulations (scums) of algae. To overcome some of these issues, passive samplers including Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) and Polar Organic Compound Integrative Samplers (POCIS) have been used for primarily marine phycotoxins with more limited application to freshwater toxins. In this study SPATT was evaluated in both the lab and the field for use as an integrative sampler for microcystins, deployed in freshwater using DIAION HP20 resin. HP20 exhibited excellent adsorption and recovery characteristics for microcystin-LR, -YR, -LA, and -RR. Approximately weekly deployments of SPATT in Pinto Lake, CA were conducted for 16months and compared to traditional (grab) samples. SPATT proved to be robust, detecting microcystins during every deployment in contrast to the grab samples, 42\% of which were below the limit of detection using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry for microcystin-LR. A simple canonical correlation model was built to determine if toxin concentrations co-varied with environmental parameters such as water temperature, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll a, rainfall, or other easily obtained variables. The best individual correlate to toxin concentration was total biomass (chlorophyll a), while the first principal axis of the canonical correlation included chlorophyll a and total dissolved nitrogen as statistically significant variables. Overall, SPATT proved to be a useful adjunct or replacement for traditional grab samples.},

Some reports indicate that chronic exposure to microcystin may result in liver damage in adults, but information on effects in children is limited., Objective: We investigated the relationship between microcystin exposure and liver damage in children., Methods: We measured microcystin concentrations in drinking water and aquatic food (carp and duck) from two lakes and four wells. Participants were 1,322 children 7–15 years of age who obtained drinking water from one of the tested sources, completed questionnaires, and provided blood samples for serum liver enzymes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT)] and serum microcystin analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with liver damage (two or more abnormal serum enzyme levels in ALT, AST, ALP, or GGT)., Results: Microcystin was detected in most samples of water and aquatic food from two lakes. Children who drank water from the lake with the highest microcystin concentrations had a total estimated daily microcystin intake of 2.03 μg, a value much higher than the tolerable daily intake (0.40 μg) proposed by the World Health Organization for children. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, use of hepatotoxic medicines, and microcystin exposure were associated with liver damage. AST and ALP levels were significantly higher in high-microcystin-exposed children than in low-exposed children and unexposed children when participants who were HBV-positive or hepatotoxic medicine users were excluded from the analysis., Conclusion: These results suggest that chronic exposure to microcystin may be associated with liver damage in children in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous phototrophic bacteria that inhabit diverse environments across the planet. Seasonally, they dominate many eutrophic lakes impacted by excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) forming dense accumulations of biomass known as cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms or cyanoHABs. Their dominance in eutrophic lakes is attributed to a variety of unique adaptations including N and P concentrating mechanisms, N2 fixation, colony formation that inhibits predation, vertical movement via gas vesicles, and the production of toxic or otherwise bioactive molecules. While some of these molecules have been explored for their medicinal benefits, others are potent toxins harmful to humans, animals, and other wildlife known as cyanotoxins. In humans these cyanotoxins affect various tissues, including the liver, central and peripheral nervous system, kidneys, and reproductive organs among others. They induce acute effects at low doses in the parts-per-billion range and some are tumor promoters linked to chronic diseases such as liver and colorectal cancer. The occurrence of cyanoHABs and cyanotoxins in lakes presents challenges for maintaining safe recreational aquatic environments and the production of potable drinking water. CyanoHABs are a growing problem in the North American (Laurentian) Great Lakes basin. This review summarizes information on the occurrence of cyanoHABs in the Great Lakes, toxicological effects of cyanotoxins, and appropriate numerical limits on cyanotoxins in finished drinking water.},

Nishizawa et al. (1999) J. Biochem. 126, 520-529]. By sequencing an additional 34 kb of DNA from microcystin-producing Microcyatis aeruginosa K-139, we identified the residual microcystin synthetase gene operon, which consists of mcyD, mcyE, tncyF, and mcyG, in the opposite orientation to the mcyABC operon. McyD consisted of two polyketide synthase modules, and McyE contained a polyketide synthase module at the N-terminus and a peptide synthetase module at the C-terminus. McyF was found to exhibit similarity to amino acid racemase. McyG consisted of a peptide synthetase module at the N-terminus and a polyketide synthase at the C-terminus. The microcystin synthetase gene cluster was conserved in another microcystin-producing strain, Microcyatis sp. S-70, which produces Microcystin-LR, -RR, and -YR. Insertional mutagenesis of mcyA, mcyD, or mcyE in Microcystis sp. S-70 abolished microcystin production. In conclusion, the mcyDEFG operon is presumed to be responsible for 3-amino-9-methoxy-2,63-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4,6-dienoic acid (Adda) biosynthesis, and the incorporation of Adda and glutamic acid into the microcystin molecule.},

	abstract = {The wide distribution of cyanobacteria in aquatic environments leads to the risk of water contamination by cyanotoxins, which generate environmental and public health issues. Measurements of cell densities or pigment contents allow both the early detection of cellular growth and bloom monitoring, but these methods are not sufficiently accurate to predict actual cyanobacterial risk. To quantify cyanotoxins, analytical methods are considered the gold standards, but they are laborious, expensive, time-consuming and available in a limited number of laboratories. In cyanobacterial species with toxic potential, cyanotoxin production is restricted to some strains, and blooms can contain varying proportions of both toxic and non-toxic cells, which are morphologically indistinguishable. The sequencing of cyanobacterial genomes led to the description of gene clusters responsible for cyanotoxin production, which paved the way for the use of these genes as targets for PCR and then quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thus, the quantification of cyanotoxin genes appeared as a new method for estimating the potential toxicity of blooms. This raises a question concerning whether qPCR-based methods would be a reliable indicator of toxin concentration in the environment. Here, we review studies that report the parallel detection of microcystin genes and microcystin concentrations in natural populations and also a smaller number of studies dedicated to cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin. We discuss the possible issues associated with the contradictory findings reported to date, present methodological limitations and consider the use of qPCR as an indicator of cyanotoxin risk.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the Earth's oldest known oxygen-evolving photosynthetic microorganisms, and they have had major impacts on shaping our current atmosphere and biosphere. Their long evolutionary history has enabled cyanobacteria to develop survival strategies and persist as important primary producers during numerous geochemical and climatic changes that have taken place on Earth during the past 3.5 billion years. Today, some cyanobacterial species form massive surface growths or ‘blooms’ that produce toxins, cause oxygen depletion and alter food webs, posing a major threat to drinking and irrigation water supplies, fishing and recreational use of surface waters worldwide. These harmful cyanobacteria can take advantage of anthropogenically induced nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), and hydrologic modifications (water withdrawal, reservoir construction). Here, we review recent studies revealing that regional and global climatic change may benefit various species of harmful cyanobacteria by increasing their growth rates, dominance, persistence, geographic distributions and activity. Future climatic change scenarios predict rising temperatures, enhanced vertical stratification of aquatic ecosystems, and alterations in seasonal and interannual weather patterns (including droughts, storms, floods); these changes all favour harmful cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters. Therefore, current mitigation and water management strategies, which are largely based on nutrient input and hydrologic controls, must also accommodate the environmental effects of global warming.},

Lake water samples (ca. 5 L) were filtered to separate intracellular microcystin (cell fraction) from extracellular microcystin (filtered lake water fraction). These fractions were analyzed to measure the total quantity of microcystin in lake water. Total amounts of extra- and intracellular microcystin were measured with high performance liquid chromatography. Concentrations of intracellular microcystin usually exceeded concentrations of extracellular microcystin (24 out of 26 times). High concentrations of intracellular microcystin were found during the exponential growth phase of the blooms, whereas concentrations of extracellular microcystin were highest at the end of the blooms. However, concentrations of extracellular microcystin remained very small ({\textless}4μg/L) compared to the levels of intracellular microcystin.

We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R.

	abstract = {The monocyclic heptapeptides microcystins (MCs), are a group of hepatotoxins, produced worldwide by some bloom-forming cyanobacterial species/strains both in marine and freshwater ecosystems. MCs are synthesized non-ribosomally by large multi-enzyme complexes consisting of different modules including polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, as well as several tailoring enzymes. More than 85 different variants of MCs have been reported to exist in nature. These are chemically stable, but undergo bio-degradation in natural water reservoirs. Direct or indirect intake of MCs through the food web is assumed to be a highly exposed route in risk assessment of cyanotoxins. MCs are the most commonly found cyanobacterial toxins that cause a major challenge for the production of safe drinking water and pose a serious threat to global public health as well as fundamental ecological processes due to their potential carcinogenicity. Here, we emphasize recent updates on different modes of action of their possible carcinogenicity. Besides the harmful effects on human and animals, MC producing cyanobacteria can also present a harmful effect on growth and development of agriculturally important plants. Overall, this review emphasizes the current understanding of MCs with their occurrence, geographical distribution, accumulation in the aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystems, biosynthesis, climate-driven changes in their synthesis, stability and current aspects on its degradation, analysis, mode of action and their ecotoxicological effects.},

	abstract = {Toxic cyanobacterial blooms impose a health risk to recreational users, and monitoring of cyanobacteria and associated toxins is required to assess this risk. Traditionally, monitoring for risk assessment is based on cyanobacterial biomass, which assumes that all cyanobacteria potentially produce toxins. While these methods may be cost effective, relatively fast, and more widely accessible, they often lead to an overestimation of the health risk induced by cyanotoxins. Monitoring methods that more directly target toxins, or toxin producing genes, may provide a better risk assessment, yet these methods may be more costly, usually take longer, or are not widely accessible. In this study, we compared six monitoring methods (fluorometry, microscopy, qPCR of 16S and mcyE, ELISA assays, and LC-MS/MS), of which the last three focussed on the most abundant cyanotoxin microcystins, across 11 lakes in the Netherlands during the bathing water season (May-October) of 2019. Results of all monitoring methods significantly correlated with LC-MS/MS obtained microcystin levels (the assumed ‘golden standard’), with stronger correlations for methods targeting microcystins (ELISA) and microcystin genes (mcyE). The estimated risk levels differed substantially between methods, with 78 \% and 56 \% of alert level exceedances in the total number of collected samples for fluorometry and microscopy-based methods, respectively, while this was only 16 \% and 6 \% when the risk assessment was based on ELISA and LC-MS/MS obtained toxin concentrations, respectively. Integrating our results with earlier findings confirmed a strong association between microcystin concentration and the biovolume of potential microcystin-producing genera. Moreover, using an extended database consisting of 4265 observations from 461 locations across the Netherlands in the bathing water seasons of 2015 – 2019, we showed a strong association between fluorescence and the biovolume of potentially toxin-producing genera. Our results indicate that a two-tiered approach may be an effective risk assessment strategy, with first a biomass-based method (fluorometry, biovolume) until the first alert level is exceeded, after which the risk level can be confirmed or adjusted based on follow-up toxin or toxin gene analyses.},

Disturbances caused by extreme weather events can have substantial effects on these ecosystems. Here, we analysed the dynamics of nutrients and the entire plankton community in two flood events and afterwards, when quasi-stable conditions were established, to investigate the effect of such disturbances on a small forest pond. We show that floodings result in repeated washout of resident organisms and hundredfold increases in nutrient load. Despite this, the microbial community recovers to a predisturbance state within two weeks of flooding through four well-defined succession phases. Reassembly of phytoplankton and especially zooplankton takes up to two times longer and features repetitive and adaptive patterns. Release of dissolved nutrients from the pond is associated with inflow rates and community recovery, and returns to predisturbance levels before microbial compositions recover. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying functional resilience of small waterbodies and are relevant to global change-induced increases in weather extremes.},

	abstract = {Annual cyanobacterial blooms dominated by Microcystis have occurred in western Lake Erie (U.S./Canada) during summer months since 1995. The production of toxins by bloom-forming cyanobacteria can lead to drinking water crises, such as the one experienced by the city of Toledo in August of 2014, when the city was rendered without drinking water for {\textgreater}2 days. It is important to understand the conditions and environmental cues that were driving this specific bloom to provide a scientific framework for management of future bloom events. To this end, samples were collected and metatranscriptomes generated coincident with the collection of environmental metrics for eight sites located in the western basin of Lake Erie, including a station proximal to the water intake for the city of Toledo. These data were used to generate a basin-wide ecophysiological fingerprint of Lake Erie Microcystis populations in August 2014 for comparison to previous bloom communities. Our observations and analyses indicate that, at the time of sample collection, Microcystis populations were under dual nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stress, as genes involved in scavenging of these nutrients were being actively transcribed. Targeted analysis of urea transport and hydrolysis suggests a potentially important role for exogenous urea as a nitrogen source during the 2014 event. Finally, simulation data suggest a wind event caused microcystin-rich water from Maumee Bay to be transported east along the southern shoreline past the Toledo water intake. Coupled with a significant cyanophage infection, these results reveal that a combination of biological and environmental factors led to the disruption of the Toledo water supply. This scenario was not atypical of reoccurring Lake Erie blooms and thus may reoccur in the future.},

	abstract = {Blooms of cyanobacteria have been documented throughout history, all over the world. Mass populations of these organisms typically present hazards to human health and are known for the production of a wide range of highly toxic metabolites-cyanotoxins, of which among the most common and most investigated are the microcystins. The toxicity of the family of microcystin congeners to animal and cell models has received much attention; however, less is known about their negative effects on human health, whether via acute or chronic exposure. Useful information may be acquired through epidemiological studies since they can contribute to knowledge of the relationships between cyanotoxins and human health in environmental settings. The aim of this review is to compile and evaluate the available published reports and epidemiological investigations of human health incidents associated with exposure to mass populations of cyanobacteria from throughout the world and to identify the occurrence and likely role of microcystins in these events. After an initial screening of 134 publications, 42 publications (25 on the chronic and 17 on the acute effects of cyanotoxins) describing 33 cases of poisonings by cyanobacterial toxins in 11 countries were reviewed. The countries were Australia, China, Sri Lanka, Namibia, Serbia, Sweden, UK, Portugal, Brazil, USA, and Canada. At least 36 publications link cyanobacteria/cyanotoxins including microcystins to adverse human health effects. The studies were published between 1960 and 2016. Although the scattered epidemiological evidence does not provide a definitive conclusion, it can serve as additional information for the medical assessment of the role of microcystins in cancer development and other human health problems. This paper discusses the major cases of cyanotoxin poisonings as well as the strengths, weaknesses, and importance of the performed epidemiological research. This study also proposes some recommendations for future epidemiological work.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

Here, the response of microbial communities after a record-breaking flood event in a highly urbanized estuary was followed. Hurricane Harvey (hereafter Harvey) was a category 4 hurricane that made landfall on the Texas coast in 2017 and lashed the Houston area with 1.4–1.7 × 1010 m3 of rainfall, disrupting the natural gradients of nutrients and salinity. Here, we utilized metagenomics to analyze how Harvey altered the microbial community of Galveston Bay over five weeks following the storm. We hypothesized that the community would shift from a marine dominated community to that of a terrestrial and freshwater origin. We found that following the storm there were changes in the distribution of species with specific metabolic capacities, such as Cyanobacteria, enriched in oxygenic photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation genes, as well as Verrucomicrobia and Betaproteobacteria, with high prevalence of the SOX complex and anoxygenic photosynthesis genes. On the other hand, dominant members of the community with more diverse metabolic capabilities showed less fluctuations in their distribution. Our results highlight how massive precipitation disturbances can alter microbial communities and how the coalescence of diverse microorganisms creates a resilient community able to maintain ecosystem services even when the system is in an altered state.},

An organic-diffusive gradients in thin films (o-DGT) passive sampler based on polyacrylamide diffusive gel and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) binding gel was developed for MCs in water. The mass accumulation of three MCs (MC-LR, –RR, and -YR) was linear over 10 days (R2 ≥ 0.98). Sampling rates (2.68–3.22 mL d−1) and diffusion coefficients (0.90–1.08 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) of three MCs were obtained at 20 °C. Two different passive samplers, o-DGT and the Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking device (SPATT), were co-deployed to estimate MC levels at three lakes in California, USA. Measured total MC concentrations were up to 10.9 μg L−1, with MC-LR the primary variant at a measured maximum concentration of 2.74 μg L−1. Time-weighted average MC concentrations by o-DGT were lower than grab water samples, probably because grab sampling measures both dissolved and particulate phases (i.e., MCs in cyanobacteria). Passive water samplers by design can only measure dissolved-phase MCs, which are considerably less during the cyanobacteria-laden periods observed. Both o-DGT and grab samples gave comparable results for three MC variants at low levels of MCs, e.g., {\textless}0.1 μg L−1. o-DGT showed a higher correlation with grab sampling than SPATT did. This study demonstrates that o-DGT can be effectively used for monitoring and evaluation of dissolved MCs in waters.},

The deterioration of water quality due to excess algal biomass in lakes has been well documented (e.g., water clarity, hypoxic conditions), but health risks associated with cyanotoxins remain largely unexplored in the absence of toxin information. This study is the first to document the presence of dissolved microcystin, anatoxin-a, cylindrospermopsin, and β-N-methylamino-l-alanine in Jordan Lake, a major drinking water reservoir in North Carolina. Saxitoxin presence was not confirmed. Multiple toxins were detected at 86\% of the tested sites and during 44\% of the sampling events between 2014 and 2016. Although concentrations were low, continued exposure of organisms to multiple toxins raises some concerns. A combination of discrete sampling and in-situ tracking (Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking [SPATT]) revealed that microcystin and anatoxin were the most pervasive year-round. Between 2011 and 2016, summer and fall blooms were dominated by the same cyanobacterial genera, all of which are suggested producers of single or multiple cyanotoxins. The study’s findings provide further evidence of the ubiquitous nature of cyanotoxins, and the challenges involved in linking CyanoHAB dynamics to specific environmental forcing factors are discussed.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms that produce toxins occur in freshwaters worldwide and yet, the occurrence and distribution patterns of many cyanobacterial secondary metabolites particularly in tropical regions are still not fully understood. Moreover, predictive models for these metabolites by using easily accessible water quality indicators are rarely discussed. In this study, we investigated the co-occurrence and spatiotemporal trends of 18 well-known and less-studied cyanobacterial metabolites (including [D-Asp3] microcystin-LR (DM-LR), [D-Asp3] microcystin-RR (DM-RR), microcystin-HilR (MC-HilR), microcystin-HtyR (MC-HtyR), microcystin-LA (MC-LA), microcystin-LF (MC-LF), microcystin-LR (MC-LR), microcystin-LW (MC-LW), microcystin-LY (MC-LY), microcystin-RR (MC-RR) and microcystin-WR (MC-WR), Anatoxin-a (ATX-a), homoanatoxin-a (HATX-a), cylindrospermospin (CYN), nodularin (NOD), anabaenopeptin A (AptA) and anabaenopeptin B (AptB)) in a tropical freshwater lake often plagued with blooms. Random forest (RF) models were developed to predict MCs and CYN and assess the relative importance of 22 potential predictors that determined their concentrations. The results showed that 11 MCs, CYN, ATX-a, HATX-a, AptA and AptB were found at least once in the studied water body, with MC-RR and CYN being the most frequently occurring, intracellularly and extracellularly. AptA and AptB were detected for the first time in tropical freshwaters at low concentrations. The metabolite profiles were highly variable at both temporal and spatial scales, in line with spatially different phytoplankton assemblages. Notably, MCs decreased with the increase of CYN, possibly revealing interspecific competition of cyanobacteria. The rapid RF prediction models for MCs and CYN were successfully developed using 4 identified drivers (i.e., chlorophyll-a, total carbon, rainfall and ammonium for MCs prediction; and chloride, total carbon, rainfall and nitrate for CYN prediction). The established models can help to better understand the potential relationships between cyanotoxins and environmental variables as well as provide useful information for making policy decisions.},

	abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) produced by cyanobacteria pose serious threats to human health. However, the contribution of long-term exposure to MCs to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains poorly documented. In this study, we estimated the environmental uptake of MCs by a small population of fishers who have lived for many years on Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu, where cyanobacterial blooms occur frequently. Serum biochemical indices of liver function and their relationships with MC contamination in these people were also investigated. Moreover, to mimic the long-term effects of MC on the livers of fishers, an animal model was established in which mice were exposed to MC-LR at an environmentally relevant level, a reference level (the no-observed adverse effect level, NOAEL), and three times the NOAEL through drinking water for 12 months. We estimated the total daily intake of MCs by fishers through contaminated lake water and food to be 5.95 μg MC-LReq, far exceeding the tolerable daily intake (2.40 μg MC-LReq) proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). More than 80\% of participants had at least one abnormal serum marker. The indices of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglyceride (TG), globulin (GLB), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) had close positive associations with MC contamination, indicating that both liver damage and lipid metabolism dysfunction were induced by chronic MC exposure. Furthermore, the animal experimental results showed that long-term exposure to MC-LR at the environmentally relevant level led to hepatic steatosis with molecular alterations in circadian rhythm regulation, lipid metabolic processes, and the cell cycle pathway. Exposure to MC-LR at or above the NOAEL worsened the pathological phenotype towards nonalcoholic steatohepatitis disease (NASH) or fibrosis. These results suggest that prolonged exposure to the reference level (NOAEL) of MC-LR could cause severe liver injury to mammals. People with long-term environmental exposure to MCs might be at high risk for developing NAFLD.},
